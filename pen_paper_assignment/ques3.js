// 3.Create an object named student with at least 5 keys (e.g., studentId, 
// studentName, grade, subjects, hobbies). One of the keys should have an 
// array as its value. Then, create a function that accepts this object in 
// destructured format, prints all the information, and calls another 
// function that will pass the key array into another function. Additionally,
//  call a function that will pass the object as a key into another function 
// and print all the keys.
