// 5. Create an object named `library` with at least 5 keys (e.g., 
// `libraryId`, `libraryName`, `location`, `books`, `staff`). One of the 
// keys should have an array as its value. Then, create a function that 
// accepts this object in a destructured format, prints all the information, 
// and calls another function that will pass the key array into another 
// function. Additionally, call a function that will pass the object as a 
// key into another function and print all the keys.
